**'Software Engineer + Data Science + Game Development == ME'**

I'm a software develepor that likes to explore the vast umbrella of commputer science. I'm a double major at NJIT YWCC with a game development minor because game development is just really cool. I ❤️ coding and building new things started off coding from playing a Minecraft game on code.org. Introduced myself to Python to dive deeper into data science and even started to make my own games through Unity using C#. Stay tuned mates! The show has just begun.
